Question:
Contains Duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109


Explanation:
Hashset to get unique values in array, to check for duplicates easily..
By traversing through the array, it checks if each number already exists in the HashSet. If a duplicate is found, it returns true. If the traversal completes without finding any duplicates, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since it iterates through the array once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the HashSet storing unique numbers.
