Question:
Sum of Two Integers
Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

-1000 <= a, b <= 1000

Soution Explanation:

Add bit by bit, be mindful of carry, after adding, if carry is still 1 then add it as well.
 It iteratively calculates the sum and carry until there is no carry left.
